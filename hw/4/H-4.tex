This homework assignment should be
submitted as a single PDF file both to D2L and to Gradescope.

General homework expectations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Homework should be typeset using LaTex.
    \item Answers should be in complete sentences and proofread.
    \item You will not plagiarize.
    \item List collaborators at the start of each question using the \texttt{collab} command.
    \item Put your answers where the \texttt{todo} command currently is (and
        remove the \texttt{todo}, but not the word \texttt{Answer}).
\end{itemize}

The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows:
$$
    F_i = \begin{cases}
            1 & i \in \{1,2\} \\
            F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} & \text{otherwise}
          \end{cases}
$$

Prove $\sum_{i=0}^n F_i = F_{n+2}-1$.

Read Chapters $4$ and $5$ of \emph{Four Colors Suffice}.

Use a ``minimal criminal'' argument to prove that if an edge is removed from a
tree, then the resulting graph has two connected components.

        \paragraph{Answer}

	A tree is defined as a connected graph that has no cycles. It follows that there is one and only one path from one vertex to any other vertex.
	
	
	The base case is the simplest tree, a graph $G$ with two vertices connected by one edge. By removing the edge, the resulting graph has two connected components. See Figure \ref{graph}.
	
	
	Assume that a tree $P$ is structured is such a way that it satisfies the condition if an edge is removed from $P$, then the resulting graph has 
	two connected components and that if a tree $G$ is created by adding an edge to $P$, it does not satisfy that condition. This makes the graph $G$ a
	minimal criminal. We can see that this forms a contradiction, however, as by adding an edge to $P$ to create $G$, we are creating a cycle. We are 
	connecting two existing vertices with an edge, creating a direct path between them, but as $P$ is a tree, there is already a path between those two vertices.
	This means that there are two paths between the vertices. Therefore, $G$ is not a tree. Thus, the minimal criminal cannot exist.
	Because there is no minimal criminal and there is a base case, the statement is true.
