\maketitle

This homework assignment should be
submitted as a single PDF file to Gradescope.

Write a two-page paper describing to me how you have grown as a student,
computer scientist, mathematician, engineer, or a researcher in this class, and
more generally, in this semester.  To support your argument, you should include
your homework or writing samples (or excerpts from them) in an appendix as
evidence (and reference them!)

If you do not feel that you've grown, explain why.

Remember, style counts. Use complete sentences.

This HW will be graded on the following scale:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No submission (0\%)
    \item Low pass (70\%)
    \item Pass (90\%)
    \item High Pass (100\%)
\end{itemize}

\qquad I have grown quite a bit as a computer scientist, mathematician, and software developer. The two 
classes that have given me the most growth this semester have been CSCI 246 and CSCI 232. I've learned new
concepts and how to apply them, as well as skills, both theoretical and practical.

\qquad At the beginning of the semester, we were asked to define concepts that we knew before coming into class.
As you can see by looking at my answers to H-0, I didn't know quite a few of the concepts. Even the ones 
that I did answer, my definitions weren't very technical or precise.
